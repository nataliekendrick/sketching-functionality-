    <p>When steching my website page I had a lot of problems luckily the demos really helped. At first I was trying to display the covers of the movies but it wouldn't appear. Luckily I managed for the images to appear and was able to understand that I could use image css to style them a bit. I was having a really hard time was creating div's within Javascript with I have never done before and to be honest I thought it was easy as creating a div in html. I wanted to create a div for the image to arrange them in a grid and I got help from Anna to create a div. </p>

     <div class="tabs">
      <a href="about.html">Abo<br>ut</a>
      <a href="director.html">Direc<br>tors</a>
      <a href="year.html">Ye<br>ar</a>
      <a href="index.html">Cover<br>Art</a>
    </div>
